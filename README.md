# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom sector using classification algorithms. It was developed as part of a data analytics course and demonstrates skills in preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and analysis using real-world datasets.

## 📌 Objective

To analyze customer behavior and predict whether a customer will leave the telecom service provider (churn) using supervised machine learning models.

## 📊 Dataset

The primary dataset used is the **Telecom Customer Churn** dataset containing features like:

- Customer demographics
- Services subscribed (e.g., phone, internet, online security)
- Account information (e.g., tenure, contract type, payment method)
- Churn status (Yes/No)

## 🧠 Classification Models Used

- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**

---

## 🔍 Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 📈 Results Summary

The models achieved good performance with varying trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability. Decision Trees offered a balance between explainability and accuracy, while k-NN was highly sensitive to feature scaling.
